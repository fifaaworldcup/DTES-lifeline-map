üìç DTES Lifeline Map: Real-Time Resource Locator

üåü Overview

The DTES Lifeline Map is a dynamic, modern solution designed to streamline the process of locating essential social services, healthcare facilities, and meal programs within Vancouver's Downtown Eastside (DTES) neighborhood.

It aims to provide a fast, intuitive, and highly scalable platform for users seeking immediate support and for service providers needing up-to-date resource information, solving the chronic problem of outdated and fragmented resource lists.

This project is currently in the Active Development stage, focused on expanding data sources and refining the user experience.

‚ú® Features

Real-Time Map View: Integrates a map library (e.g., Leaflet or Mapbox) to display geo-located service points instantly.

Service Filtering: Allows users to filter resources by category (e.g., Food, Shelter, Health, Washrooms, Detox).

Mobile-Optimized: Fully responsive interface designed for use on mobile devices by outreach workers and residents.

Data Administration Portal: A secured interface for partner organizations to update operating hours and service status in real-time.

Route Planning: Basic functionality to calculate the distance/route to the nearest selected resource.
