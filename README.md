# DTES Lifeline Map: Real-Time Resource Locator

## ✨ Overview & Mission

The DTES Lifeline Map is a dynamic, modern solution designed to streamline the process of locating essential social services, healthcare facilities, and meal programs within Vancouver's Downtown Eastside (DTES) neighborhood.

It aims to provide a fast, intuitive, and highly scalable platform for users seeking immediate support and for service providers needing up-to-date resource information, solving the chronic problem of outdated and fragmented resource lists.

This project is currently in the Active Development stage, focused on expanding data sources and refining the user experience.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Real-Time Map View**: Integrates Leaflet for geo-located service points.
- **Service Filtering**: Filter by category (e.g., Food, Shelter, Health, Naloxone, Detox).
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Fully responsive for outreach workers and residents.
- **Community Reporting**: Anonymous status updates via Firebase (optional real-time).
- **Route Planning**: Walking directions to nearest resource.
