Contributing to the DTES Lifeline Map

This project is driven by a mission to improve access to life-saving resources in the Downtown Eastside. We welcome all contributions—whether you are a developer, a designer, an outreach worker, or a local resident.

Code Contributions

Fork and Branch: Create a fork of the repository and branch off of main.

git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name


Commit Messages: Use clear, descriptive commit messages (e.g., feat: add real-time status listener or fix: correct leaflet icon path).

Code Standards:

Use modern JavaScript (ES6+).

Ensure your code is well-commented, especially complex logic around Firebase or Leaflet.

Maintain full responsiveness and accessibility (A11Y) in all UI components, as the primary users will be on mobile devices in challenging conditions.

Pull Requests (PRs): Submit PRs targeting the main branch. Ensure your PR is linked to an existing issue.

Reporting Issues and Bugs

If you find a bug or have a suggestion, please open an issue in the GitHub repository.

For Bugs: Include clear steps to reproduce the issue, what you expected, and what actually happened.

For Feature Requests: Clearly articulate the problem and how the proposed feature would benefit users (e.g., "It is difficult to see which sites are open after 9 PM. A time slider would help.").

Community Data Curation and Verification

Data quality is paramount to the mission. If you are an outreach worker or service provider interested in contributing verified resource data or helping to moderate the live status updates, please contact the project maintainers directly (see README.md) for access to the secure admin panel and data standards guide.Contributing to the DTES Lifeline Map
